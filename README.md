# glamr
SI utilities package

## Overview

When using PEPFAR data, the OHA SI PEPFAR by and large uses the same MER Structured Datasets to answer the same analytical questions each period. This package is a sister package of `ICPIutilities` for working primiarly with data from DATIM and the MER Structured Datasets and plotting them using `glitr`. Focal users are analysts in USAID/GH/OHA who are using R to pull data from DATIM or perform the same repeated functions each quarter like creating TX_NET_NEW targets or assessing achievement.


## Installation

`glamr` is not on CRAN, so you will have to install it directly from GitHub using `remotes`.

If you do not have `remotes` installed, you will have to run the `install.packages("remotes")` line in the code below as well.

``` r
## SETUP

  #install package with vignettes
    install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("USAID-OHA-SI/glamr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
    
  #load the package
    library(glamr)

## LIST TYPES OF STYLES INCLUDED WITH PACKAGE
